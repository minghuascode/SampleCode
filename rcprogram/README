T6 Remote Control
==================

The following radio remote controls are roughly the same design. 
They can be programmed using roughly the same programs.

 - HobbyKing HK-T6A
 - FlySky FS-CT6A
 - Turborix TBXT6
 - Exceed RC FS-CT6A
 - Storm ST-06TX
 - CopterX CX-CT6A
 - Jamara FCX 6


How to program a t6 remote control
===================================

[1] There is a binary config program from t6 vendors. 
    See t6config subdir under rcbinaries project.

[2] Another app, is Qt based source code from modelisme.com.
    Only problem is that it's in a foreign language.
    See t6src subdirectory under this project. 

[3] Three alternative ways.  See t6Alternate.html. 

[3.1] DigitalRadio.exe. See mono subdir for linux use.
      To use this program on linux, we build mono first. 

[3.2] Charles Conklin's .Net application. We don't keep this program.

[3.3] Turborix.exe and AtEasy. See turborix subdir under rcbinaries.
      Basically, you install ATEasy as a driver, then run turborix.exe.


[3.4] There is a MAC turborix app mentioned by t6Alternate.html.
      It has a better interface among all. We don't keep this program.
