Building SpiderMonkey 1.8 or earlier

To build, use these commands:

tar xvzf js-1.8.0-rc1.tar.gz
cd js/src
make -f Makefile.ref

This builds a debug version of SpiderMonkey. All build files are created in a subdirectory named depending on your system (for example, Linux_All_DBG.OBJ if you are on Linux). To install this build on your system, see SpiderMonkey installation instructions.

To build an optimized (non-debug) version of SpiderMonkey:

make BUILD_OPT=1 -f Makefile.ref

To build a thread-safe version of SpiderMonkey:

make JS_DIST=/full/path/to/directory/containing/nspr JS_THREADSAFE=1 -f Makefile.ref


Testing SpiderMonkey

The commands below assume you're using the advanced build.

    * Run ./js ../perfect.js and check if appropriate output is printed.
    * Run the main test suite by running ../tests/jstests.py ./js
